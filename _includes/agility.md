A1K9 Behaviour and Training Academy is set in the heart of the countryside with glorious views surrounding it.
We have a large comprehensive agility course that is positioned to make the most of the 360 degree views which are truly breath-taking.

The agility course includes a tunnel, an A frame, hurdle, overhead walk, long jump, scale jump, platform, tyre jump, a weave, see saw, log obstacle and barrel obstacle.

Once you have passed the Bronze Obedience course and have basic on lead control of your dog, you can go on to the Silver Obedience Course where we include agility as a reward and a confidence builder for your dog;  the dogs really love the activity and it is a good outlet for their energy.

Your dog must be 12 months old to do the entire agility course, as prior to this the pup's bones are still growing. Younger dogs can still do things like the tunnel and weaving gently through the weave poles. You will be taught how to incentivise your dog to use the equipment and how to use the equipment in a safe manner.  

Agility is held in the Silver, Gold and Platinum Courses
