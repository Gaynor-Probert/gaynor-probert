<h3>Ali the Rotti</h3>

<p>Dear Gaynor,</p>

<p>Once again we would like to express our thanks to you for your visit to us and Ali William on November 14th and for the wonderful, detailed, thoughtful and comprehensive report that you have written and sent to us and to Ali's' Veterinary Practice.</p>

<p>It was a real pleasure to meet and spend the afternoon with you: an afternoon that has changed our daily lives dramatically
for the better and which has resulted in peaceful pleasurable lives for Harry, myself and Ali.</p>

<p>Ali is a beautiful, intelligent, loving character with a marvelous temperament as you know. Now it is just up to us to persevere with your advice and training that has worked miracles from day one:we just have to "keep up the good work".</p>

<p>Ali had this year become most boisterous, destructive of our belongings and furniture and was acting like a very spoiled and naughty boy and that situation was unsustainable and we were nearly at the end of our tether.</p>

<p>You came into our home and transformed our lives and that of Ali's and we really cannot thank you enough.</p>

<p>We now have a contented boy who is learning everything very quickly and our time with him is now all pleasurable and it is
marvelous to see how his behaviour has changed him into being relaxed, obedient and content.</p>

<p>We all hope to see you again in the near future. Many, many thanks.</p>

<p>Kindest Regards, </p>

<p><strong>Harry, David and Ali William</strong></p>
