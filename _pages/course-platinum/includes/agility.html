	<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail pull-left" src="~/images/courses/platinum/tire-jump-v1.png" style="margin-right: 10px;" />
	<p>The agility is done off lead as now you are able to have full control your dog.</p>
	<p>In this course you will have taught your dog off lead control including distance commands.</p>
	<p>All sorts of control under lots of different circumstances, this is obedience at the highest level.</p>
	<p>As we said at the beginning, a well behaved dog is a joy to live with and when you have completed your courses with Gaynor Probert at A1K9 Behaviour and Training Academy, you can demonstrate that your dog can behave in the home, in public places and in the presence of other dogs in a manner that will reflect credit on you and your dog.</p>
	<p>Dogs that have been trained and have good manners are more likely to be accepted in hotels or kennels and can be looked after by others should the need arise.</p>
	<p>The dog's life is not curtailed because he does not behave.</p>
	<p>Your dog can live a full and happy life, being with you and sharing your life wherever you are.</p>
