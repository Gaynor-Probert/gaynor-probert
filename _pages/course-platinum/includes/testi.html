<h3>Glenda and Bryn</h3>

<p>A big thank you to Gaynor for all the patient help and advice she has given in training me and our Working Cocker Spaniel Bryn. We started in puppy classes where he was affectionately(!!?) known as "The Pocket Rocket" and often seen as a black dot in the distance but Gaynor's support and expertise has seen our (continuing) progress through the ranks to the Platinum group.</p>

<p>Thanks again Gaynor! Your training means that Bryn can enjoy the freedom of a full and active life and it's a pleasure to be out and about with him. You made us work hard but we've had a lot of fun too.</p> 

<p><strong>Glenda</strong></p>
