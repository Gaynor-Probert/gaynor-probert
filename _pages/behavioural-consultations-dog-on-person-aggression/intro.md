Dog on Person Aggression
========================

A dog that is aggressive to people is one of the most serious problems that I deal with.

 Left unchecked this behaviour can escalate to a degree that is dangerous and makes owning a dog like this a chore. The sooner you seek professional help from a behaviourist the better your chances of rehabilitating you dog.
