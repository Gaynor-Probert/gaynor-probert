<h3>Keith and Magic</h3>

<p><strong>Hello Gaynor and everyone at A1k9</strong></p>

<p>We have always grown up with a dog so when our last German shepherd passed away at the age of 5 due to lymphoma, we were devastated. The house seemed empty and we just sat around looking at each other. After a while we decided we would have another German shepherd and we bought this black bundle of fluff.  We fell in love with him but as he grew, we found that he had a mind of his own and wanted to have his own way, we found it difficult to get him do what we wanted. We thought we were feeding him the wrong diet which could be making him hyperactive but we were wrong - the simple truth was that he needed more discipline.  </p>

<p>We phoned A1K9 and explained the situation to a very pleasant lady called Gaynor and she suggested that we attend training classes.  WHAT A LIFE SAVER. After going to classes regularly, handler and dog have improved greatly.  We still attend classes and find that he is learning something new all the time.  When Magic goes off and does his own thing the rest of the class see the funny side but he's learning to be a good boy now.</p>

<p>We would like to say thank you to Gaynor and her assistants for their patience and understanding with Magic and handler.  
Lots of thanks to you all</p>

<p><strong>Magic, Keith and Annette</strong></p>
