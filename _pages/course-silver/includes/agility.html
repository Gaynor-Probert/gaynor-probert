<p>Agility courses are great fun, and dogs love the activity.</p>
<p>Dogs need to be over 12 months of age, to complete a full agility course.</p>
	<p>Younger dogs, can enjoy some of the obstacles, such as going through the tunnels and controlled walking over raised walkways and learning to go through the weave poles.&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>Over the six week silver course</strong> you will have prepared your dog for off lead obedience and have more control over your dog in different situations. And continued your dog's socialisation.</p>
