	<p><strong>The most critical time in your dog's life is right now!</strong></p>
	<p>Puppyhood is the time when your influence and what you do with your pup will have an everlasting effect.</p>
	<p>The help and guidance you receive from Gaynor Probert at A1K9 Behaviour and Training Academy, can make a profound difference on the success of your relationship with your dog.</p>
	<h3>Responsible dog ownership</h3>
	<p>As your pup develops over the coming months, Gaynor will teach you, the most important aspects of your dog's education and how to develop him to be a well behaved and balanced pet you have always wanted.</p>
	<p>These classes are the starting point for all puppies under the age of 5 months.</p>
	<p>You do not have to book into this half hour class. Once your puppy has had both its vaccinations, you can come and join the fun, puppies get the opportunity to meet and play with other pups off lead in our fenced fields, under the watchful eye of our Gaynor and her assistants, who with their specialist knowledge of dog body language will prevent any over exuberance.</p>
	<p>We also have a large purpose built dog training barn so that we can go indoors when the weather is inclement, it is filled with sand for a soft landing when playing and ensuring that your puppy's socialisation and education continues no matter what the weather.</p>
	<p>Puppies grow and mature much faster than humans, therefore the earlier you get your pup accepting and happy around dogs and people they don't know, the happier they will be in the both the company of people and other dogs that they meet.</p>
	<p>Clicker training is one of the methods that Gaynor uses at A1K9 Behaviour and Training Academy, to condition your puppy ready to go on into the Bronze dog obedience course.</p>
	<p>Teaching your dog to sit, to lie down and to return to you when called, is the beginning of you dogs training, that is done easily and in a fun way with a clicker.</p>
