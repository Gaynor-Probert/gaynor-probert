<h3>Poppy</h3>

<p>I just wanted to pass on my thanks to you for my 1-2-1 dog training recently.  I was slowly losing the little bit of confidence that I did have when taking Poppy for a walk and when attending the Bronze Obedience class on a Sunday but in the hour that we spent with you my faith has been restored!!  Since attending the 1-2-1 I have walked Poppy a number of times and it is like walking a different dog!  I know we have a long way to go but I can now look forward to attending the Sunday obedience classes and enjoy taking Poppy for a walk.</p>

<p>Thanks again for your time it is really appreciated.</p>
 
<p><strong>Emma, Kevin, Martha and Poppy</strong></p>
