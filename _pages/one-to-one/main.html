		<p>Classes are not always right environment for some people, nor do they suit all dogs, and there are lots of different reasons why. For instance you work shifts or have other commitments. Maybe you have time constraints that prevent you from coming to a class every week.</p>
		<p>Not everyone has the skills to get their dog to the standard that they wish to achieve and they want help to progress to a higher level of competence. You may want to work on a specific aspect of training that you are finding difficult</p>
		<p>Perhaps you do not like to train your dog with other people around as it makes you feel self-conscious</p>
		<p>Sometimes classes are just not suitable for your dog's temperament.</p>
		<p>Perhaps just as some people have a personal trainer to help them get fit, you would like a personal trainer to help you get the very best from your dog.<br />
			1 to 1 training is often the best way to improve your dog training skills.</p>
		<h3>What to expect when you have a 1 to 1 obedience training session with Gaynor Probert.</h3>
		<p>When you first meet Gaynor, she will have a chat about what your main objective is, and what you hope to achieve in the session.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Gaynor will then work with your dog to assess your dog and evaluate which is the best way to incentivise your pet to reach your objective, and then she will teach you how to use this to achieve your goals.</p>
		<p>Gaynor will give you, hands on pragmatic help and show you how to get your dog to do the obedience you require. you will then practice the new techniques and skills that you have been taught, so that you are able to practice them at home.</p>
