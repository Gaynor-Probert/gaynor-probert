<h3>Linda with Bella</h3>

<p>A HUGE thank you to Gaynor and her assistants at A1K9. I have just come back from a walk in our local park with Bella, our 15 month old GSD. This sounds like a normal activity - and it is, but it wasn't for us. </p>

<p>Months of weekly training in Gaynor's classes, from Puppy through to Platinum and beyond, has transformed me and my dog. We have gone from a dog that I couldn't control, one that wouldn't listen to me and one that ran off barking at other people and other dogs TO an obedient, well behaved dog that for the first time today I had the confidence to let off the lead in the park. She listened to me, she socialised beautifully, she came back to heel when I called her. I cannot thank Gaynor enough for this. It has been 10 months of hard work and lots of practice in between lessons, but it has paid off. </p>

<p>Totally recommend this training with Gaynor at A1K9. Thanks guys and see you Saturday, from a very happy Linda and family xxx</p>
