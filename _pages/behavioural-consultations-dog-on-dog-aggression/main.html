		<h3>What to expect in a behavioural consultation.</h3>
		<p>Firstly Gaynor will talk about the problems you are having with your dog and what has led you to this point, so that she can &nbsp;gather the relevant information needed to formulate an accurate picture to assist her with her diagnoses of your dog's aggression problem.</p>
		<p>Then she will test your dog for its aggressive behaviour toward other dogs using A1K9 dogs as stooge dogs if necessary, to enable her to observe your dog's conduct, to aid her in her diagnosis. Gaynor will then work with your dog to evaluate what is the best way to rehabilitate him/her.</p>
		<p>She will then explain what the problem is and what she believe is the most probable cause.</p>
		<p>Once this is established, Gaynor will then show you the techniques and skills required to use whatever equipment she think would be best to rehabilitate your dog.</p>
		<p>Gaynor may &nbsp;ask you to attend a behavioural modification programme or stay in touch via email or telephone, to enable her to monitor your progress After the consultation she will write a full report and send a copy to your vet unless you request otherwise.</p>
