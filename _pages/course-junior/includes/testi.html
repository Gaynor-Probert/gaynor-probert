<h3>Susan and </h3>

<p>Gaynor is so inspirational and the support & guidance is outstanding. With a young puppy it's so hard to remember everything you need to do whilst training but the patience and reassurance from Gaynor and her team makes training so much fun and rewarding.</p>

<p>Such a professional, well organised setup and carrying incredible high standard however still with a friendliness, approachability and warmth I can't recommend highly enough. I truly feel privileged to be able to participate in the training courses. Hats off, and credit where credit is due. Gaynor Probert......omg she's good!</p>
