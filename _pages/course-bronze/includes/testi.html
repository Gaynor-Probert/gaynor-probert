<h3>Ozzy</h3>

<p>I have a 6 month old malamute and it is quite normal for the breed to be stubborn, ignorant, and generally Mischievous and Ozzy is all of these things.</p>

<p>Since coming to Gaynor at A1K9 for the Bronze Obedience Course some seven weeks ago I must say I thought I had my work cut out, but Gaynor has an amazing connection with all the dogs and her skills and experience shines through. The way she has taught me and Ozzy is absolutely amazing and I have now realised that I really have struck gold coming to class.</p>

<p>We have now started week one of the silver course and I am so pleased with our progress. My malamute Ozzy has shown me a different side of him which is amazing, THANK YOU GAYNOR AND YOUR STAFF! </p>

<p>P.S. if you are thinking about going to Gaynor, it's a no brainer!  Just do it.</p>
